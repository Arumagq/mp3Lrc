[ti:Farmers Use Creative Methods to Grow Crops]

[00:00.00]Many areas of cropland in Bangladesh are becoming unfit for farming. 
[00:07.00]The land is becoming salty. 
[00:10.36]It is a big problem for the small country. 
[00:14.72]More than 155 million people live in Bangladesh. 
[00:21.11]Growing crops is the most common way Bangladeshis support themselves.
[00:29.41]Farmers in the country are learning to grow vegetables 
[00:35.09]in so-called "vertical gardens." 
[00:37.82]The soil in these gardens is better 
[00:41.36]because heavy rains have removed much of the salt.
[00:46.23]The village of Chandipur is in southwestern Bangladesh. 
[00:56.03]Pumpkins and other gourds grow on vines on top of small homes. 
[01:02.48]The vegetables get the food they need 
[01:05.63]from soil placed in containers on the ground.
[01:09.69]Shobitha Debna is a 35-year-old farmer in the village. 
[01:15.61]Her garden space is very small. 
[01:18.70]But she is able to grow hundreds of kilograms of vegetables each season.
[01:25.99]She says she grows gourds, including pumpkin, 
[01:37.66]as well as green beans, red amaranth, beets, carrots, cauliflower and more.
[01:45.09]Ms. Debna depends on the vegetables to earn money. 
[01:50.08]She makes a few dollars a day.
[01:53.43]This kind of farming is new in Chandipur. 
[01:57.79]But it may spread across the country.
[02:01.03]Most of Bangladesh is at or below sea level. 
[02:05.92]Rising seawaters linked to climate change has severely affected the country. 
[02:12.79]High water from storms in coastal areas also add salt to soil. 
[02:20.47]High salt content makes crops less productive.
[02:24.78]The flow of seawater from storms like Cyclone Aila in 2009 
[02:32.08]damage much of the soil in farm areas. 
[02:35.82]The salty water flows into rivers, 
[02:39.32]which then flood Chandipur and other villages. 
[02:43.48]Vegetable crops fail. 
[02:45.71]For three years now, 
[02:48.33]hundreds of villagers have grown crops in vertical gardens. 
[02:53.06]The international non-profit group WorldFish Center 
[02:57.92]brought vertical gardens to Bangladesh.
[03:01.30]Dr. Craig Meisner is the South Asia country director for WorldFish Center. 
[03:08.16]He told VOA, "there is no country with such population density 
[03:14.37]where natural resources are stretched to their very limits."
[03:18.55]He says if climate change adaptation fails in Bangladesh, 
[03:24.28]it is sure to fail in many other countries. 
[03:27.93]However, he says, if it succeeds "it gives hope for the world's future."
[03:35.23]From July to October, about 1.5 meters of rain falls in Bangladesh. 
[03:43.86]The seasonal rains remove salt from the soil. 
[03:47.88]At the end of the rainy season, 
[03:50.86]villagers collect the cleaned soil and place it in large containers. 
[03:56.94]They use that soil to grow vegetables.
[04:00.72]WorldFish Center has trained about 200 villagers in southwestern Bangladesh 
[04:09.13]to make vertical gardens. 
[04:10.90]Over the next two years, 
[04:14.25]the center will train about 5,000 people.
[04:17.99]There are some people who are not part of the WorldFish Center program. 
[04:24.21]But they are still using vertical gardens. 
[04:27.61]They made them after seeing their neighbors' designs.
[04:32.83]Nurun Nabi is a program officer at WorldFish Center. 
[04:38.72]He says two farmers stopped him last year 
[04:43.12]on a village road to talk about the vertical gardens. 
[04:47.73]He said they demanded to be part of the training group.
[04:52.30]A vertical garden is easy to make. 
[04:56.69]Villagers fill containers with good soil and natural fertilizers. 
[05:02.32]They put the containers on bricks so they are off the ground. 
[05:07.10]They add pieces of the bricks to the soil to help water flow and drain.
[05:13.94]The farmers cut small holes into the sides of the containers. 
[05:19.55]This permits vegetables with short roots a place to grow. 
[05:25.15]Vegetables with long roots grow on top of the container. 
[05:30.60]One bag of soil can produce up to eight kilograms of vegetables in one season.
[05:38.14]Villagers also grow vegetables in containers made from large, 
[05:44.06]thin pieces of plastic supported by bamboo. 
[05:48.37]This "vertical tower" measures more than a meter wide. 
[05:54.11]Each of these towers can produce more than 100 kilograms of vegetables. 
[06:00.89]It costs about $12-$13 to build.
