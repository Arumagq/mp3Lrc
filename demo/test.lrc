[00:00.00]Now, the VOA Special English program, Words and Their Stories.
[00:16.64]There are many American expressions about insects --
[00:21.62] like bees, for example.
[00:23.90]Bees are known as very hard workers.
[00:27.40]They always appear to be busy, moving around their homes, or hives.
[00:33.38]So you might say you were as busy as a bee
[00:37.86]if you spent your weekend cleaning your house.
[00:41.40]In fact, you might say your house was a beehive of activity
[00:47.82]if your whole family was helping you clean.
[00:51.16]You also might say you made a beeline for something
[00:57.44]if you went there right away.
[00:59.72]When we go to see a movie,
[01:02.96]my friend always makes a beeline
[01:06.96]for the place where they sell popcorn.
[01:10.14]Here is an expression about bees that is not used much any more,
[01:16.47]but we like it anyway.
[01:18.67]We think it was first used in the nineteen twenties.
[01:24.30]If something was the best of its kind,
[01:29.14]you might say it was the bee's knees.
[01:33.17]Now, we admit that we do not know how this expression developed.
[01:39.60]If fact, we do not even know if bees have knees!
[01:44.63]If your friend cannot stop talking about something
[01:49.42]because she thinks it is important,
[01:52.15]you might say she has a bee in her bonnet.
[01:56.73]If someone asks you a personal question,
[02:00.81]you might say "that is none of your beeswax."
[02:05.84]This means none of your business.
[02:09.62]Speaking of personal questions,
[02:13.30]there is an expression people sometimes use when their children ask,
[02:19.04]"where do babies come from?"
[02:21.73]Parents who discuss sex and reproduction say
[02:26.95]this is talking about the birds and the bees.
[02:30.84]Hornets are bee-like insects that sometimes attack people.
[02:37.92]It you are really angry, you might say you are mad as a hornet.
[02:44.34]And if you stir up a hornet's nest,
[02:48.53]you create trouble or problems.
[02:52.01]Butterflies are beautiful insects,
[02:57.29]but you would not want to have butterflies in your stomach.
[03:02.31]That means to be nervous about having to do something,
[03:07.55]like speaking in front of a crowd.
[03:10.49]You would also not want to have ants in your pants.
[03:16.16]That is, to be restless and unable to sit still.
[03:21.19]Here are some expressions about plain old bugs,
[03:26.76]another word for insects.
[03:29.41]If a friend keeps asking you to do something you do not want to do,
[03:35.63]you might ask him to leave you alone or "stop bugging me."
[03:40.91]A friend also might tell you again and again to do something.
[03:46.34]If so, you might say he put a bug in your ear.
[03:51.31]If you were reading a book in your warm bed on a cold winter's day,
[03:58.11]you might say you were snug as a bug in a rug.
[04:03.56]And, if you wish someone good night, you might say,
[04:08.48]"sleep tight -- don't let the bed bugs bite."
